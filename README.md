# Nghi's Computer Documentation
Documentation for how to install, delete, configure, and fix things on my Linux, Windows, and MacOSdevices. 

Documentation will be split into three categories:
* **Installation** - This will keep track of the software I need to install and any special instructions I need to follow to get it successfully installed.
* **[Configuration](https://github.com/bastiel/computer-docs/tree/main/configurations%20)** - Not all programs are perfect out the box, so this will keep track of the changes I need to make to be satisfied with its performance and/or content. 
* **[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/bastiel/computer-docs/tree/main/troubleshoot%20)** - I will inevitably run into bugs, so this will keep track of what went wrong and possible steps I can take to resolve and avoid the bug.
